# Wifi+Sigfox based geolocation d√©mo

## Purpose

* Gather the MAC address of the two "strongest" wifi networks
* Send them over the Sigfox network
* Use Google Geolocation API to get an approximate location
* Publish to Slack a Google Maps snapshot of the computed location

This a *demo* and not intended to be used in production.  
This does not tackle

* Battery optimisation
* Code robustness
* Data compression
* ...

## Hardware

* Using a [SiPy](https://www.pycom.io/product/sipy/) from Pycom, which combines Sigfox & Wifi connectivities.
The SiPy is programmed in micropython, find the sample code in the [sipy](./sipy) folder
* [Arduino MKR1000](https://store.arduino.cc/product/GBX00011) + [SNOC Breakout Board - Sigfox BRKWS01](https://yadom.fr/carte-breakout-sfm10r1.html). It works with the Arduino IDE, find the samples code in the [mkr1000-snoc](./mkr1000-snoc) folder.

## Cloud application

Basic nodeJS application, which receive the Sigfox callback & calls the Google & Slack apis  

Check the [server](./server) folder

## Slack notification

Here is the kind of notification that you will receive :
